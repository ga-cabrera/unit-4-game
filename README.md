I know that my JS code is extremely repetitive, and I don't like it. I did, however, find another way to simplify the code and drastically reduce the amount of lines I've used, but I just didn't know how to properly execute it. Maybe with some help, I'll figure it out but I was running out of time and as annoying as it is type, copy and paste the same code multiple times, it was the fastest way at the time. 

Bootstrap is on the HTML page but I didn't make the time to fully take advantage of it. I'll will though in the next couple of days.

I focused hard on the JS and prioritized that first, and I will get to the rest very soon! Thanks for playing my game.
